<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App -->

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

# Just another personal project

This is a personal project just to get a portfolio up an running. I may change things around in the future if I can finally focus to finish my billion other side projects.

This is build on react, pics used throughout the project were found on google, and my cats are just embedded from google photos (no hosting required!).

I'll probably deploy to netlify since its easy and super fast to use. Will link when its up :)


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
